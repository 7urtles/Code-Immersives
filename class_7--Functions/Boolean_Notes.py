# WORKING WITH BOOLEANS

'''
Booleans are either True or False

Booleans are used to evaluate a condition
'''

# A comparison will evaluate to its boolean answer.
4 < 9 # <-- This will evaluate to True.

4 > 9 # <-- This will evaluate to False.


# That result may be printed out.
print(4 < 9)

# The result can be stored to a variable.
boolean_value = 4 < 9

# Then the result can be printed.
print(boolean_value)

'''
Some comparison operators are:
    x < y   Checks if x is less than y
    x > y   Checks if x is greater than y
    x <= y  Checks if x is less than or equal to y
    x >= y  Checks if x is greater than or equal to y
    x == y  Checks if x is equal to y
