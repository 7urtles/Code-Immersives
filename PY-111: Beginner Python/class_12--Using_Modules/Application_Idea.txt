Automated application to retrieve and post new assignments from Populi into Slack:

Libraries/Extras Needed:
    -Selenium
    -Slacks Bot Application API
    -Populi API access

Concept:
    -The script will use my Populi account data to log in and retrieve a list of assignments.
    -Save those assignments to a text file.
    -Repeat the process and look for assignments not found in the text file.
    -When one is found, using a Slack Bot Application, it will be posted into the general chat
     and added to the known assignments list

Issues:
    -Selenium is very slow and resource heavy:
        Selenium does not work in headless server environments. This means it cannot be released to a 
        dedicated server and left to run. Currently it is running on my home computer and consuming
        ~180MB of RAM. Not ideal for anything except proof of concept.

        Utilizing the Popouli API would reduce overhead by 10 times and remove the need for simulated 
        keyboard input. Not doing so is restricting the application from being deployed on my home server 
        or to a cloud hosted solution such as Linode, Amazon, Azure, etc....

Fixes:
    -Access to the Populi API will allow much faster running times and lower resource consumption:
        The bot only needs access to a Populi account with 'Staff' privileges. 
        'Admin' privileges are not necessary.


Extra Features:

        Populi API access would also open the door to interaction between Populi and Slack via 
        the Bot Application.
        
        Here are some example of the features API access would enable instructors to do via the Slack Bot:
            -Create Populi assignments
            -View Populi assignment submitions
            -Monitor late/missing assignments
            -Run students code assignments in order to grade them
            -Submit assignment grades to Populi


A working prototype is currently deployed to slack and available for demonstration of what is
listed in the 'Concept' section above. Thank you for reading!
