An application to retrieve and post new assignments from Populi into Slack

Libraries/Extras Needed:
    -Selenium
    -Slacks Bot Application API
    -Populi API access

Concept:
    -The script will use my Populi account data to log in and retrieve a list of assignments.
    -Save those assignments to a text file.
    -Repeat the process and look for assignments not found in the text file.
    -When one is found, using a Slack Bot Application, it will be posted into the general chat
        and added to the known assignments list

Issues:
    -Selenium is very slow and resource heavy.
    -Selenium does not work well in headless server environments.

Fixes:
    -Access to the Populi API will allow much faster running times and lower resource consumption
