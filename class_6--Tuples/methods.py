# Tuple Methods
'''
Methods take input, process the input, give an output
'''

    # all() 
    # Returns True if all objects in tuple are true.
    #       Usage: all(some_tuple)
    #       Returns: a True or False boolean


    # any() 
    # Returns True if any object in tuple is true.
    #       Usage: any(some_tuple)
    #       Returns: a True or False boolean


    # len() 
    # Returns the length of the tuple.
    #       Usage: len(some_tuple)
    #       Returns: an integer value


    # min() 
    # Returns the smallest value in the tuple.
    #       Note: since the operation is a comparison,
    #           tuple values should be of the same type.
    #       Usage: min(some_tuple)
    #       Returns: the lowest value object from the tuple


    # max() 
    # Returns the largest value in the tuple.
    #       Note: since the operation is a comparison,
    #           tuple values should be of the same type.
    #       Usage: max(some_tuple)
    #       Returns: the highest value object from the tuple


    # sorted() 
    # Returns a sorted version of the tuple.
    #       Note1: Does a conversion to a list since tuples are immutable
    #       Note2: since the operation is a comparison,
    #           tuple values should be of the same type.
    #       Usage: sorted(some_tuple)
    #       Returns: a sorted list version of the tuple


    # sum() 
    # Returns the largest value in the tuple.
    #       Note: since the operation is an addition operation,
    #           tuple values should be of the same type.
    #       Usage: sum(some_tuple)
    #       Returns: an object from the tuple

    # tuple() 
    # This method is a constructor, it builds a tuple from given values.
    #       Usage: tuple('these', 'are', 'some', 'values')
    #       Returns: a tuple object
