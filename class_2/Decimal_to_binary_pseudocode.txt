Converting Decimal to Binary:

    1) Get number from the user
    2) create a list of even numbers incrementing by n*2
    3) reverse the list
    4) for every item in the list:
    5) check if the users number is larger than the first list number
    6) if so subtract it and denote a 1 for a digit of Binary
    7) if not denote a 0 for a digit of binary
